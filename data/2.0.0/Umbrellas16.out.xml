<p id="p11">In this book seventy writers respond to the challenge: 'choose a 
location in Edinburgh and write about it.' Straight and simple. 
Yet as you're about to witness, this has given rise to a myriad 
trove of variegated perspectives, voices and worlds. Edinburgh, 
here, becomes the multifarious sum of diversely enchanted, 
slanted, elated, deflated, rich, weird, splendid, cacophonous and 
sonorous works.</p>

<p id="p12">Writing about a place might seem a very basic thing for 
writers to do. But pick it apart a little. The place is always 
coloured by the perceiver, and the perceiver is always coloured 
by the place. The poem is an artful conjunction of two highly 
complex entities. More than this, the place will always be a space 
in time, so that no place can be the same place twice, just as no 
person remains static. And this is before we begin to think of 
what a poem is, or might be. A poem implies living language and 
shape or pattern. But what are these? They are not monolithic or 
simple entities, that's for sure.</p> 

<p id="p13">If seventy writers were to choose a location in any single 
town or city in the world, and write about it, one might expect 
multiplicity. But there's something captivating about Edinburgh. 
All great cities have their own literary traditions, their own 
seed-bed of codes. But start writing about Edinburgh and it's 
hard not to feel that every stone in the place is a stereotype, 
every vista an archetype. It was no help to these writers that 
Edinburgh is a UNESCO World heritage site, with over 4500 
listed buildings, as well as the world's first UNESCO City of 
Literature. Such an apex of heritage, for the writer seeking to 
speak to today, might as well be a vortex. And yet the depth and 
pull of the city's codes intoxicate the imagination. The in-your-
face actuality of its symbolic allure, seeping from its streets as 
you go about your day, and night, cannot be ignored.
Named in the 10th century Pictish Chronicle as 'oppidum</p> 


</page>
<page number="10" proc="no">

<p id="p14">Eden' (gaining its burgh in the early 12th century) and 
contained within its own walls for at least the following 500 
years, Edinburgh grew upwards, stacked high with multi-storey 
buildings, where the social low and high occupied differing 
floors of the same tenements. Noted in the early C18th as one of 
the most thronged and putrid cities in Europe, the bourgeoisie 
would eventually, of course, move across to the 'New Town', 
whence one of the most archetypal urban psycho-geographies 
of the Western world would develop. To this day it is difficult to 
conceive of Edinburgh outside of oppositions: the old and the 
new; the light and the dark; the teeming and the spacious; the 
fine and the feral. Yet in the most compelling experiences of the 
contemporary city, these aren't segregated but are simultaneous.</p> 

<p id="p15">Perhaps fundamental to the imaginative lure of Edinburgh 
is its trick of being at once circumscribed yet seemingly 
bottomless. The place is physically hemmed in by its hills and 
the firth, it's not huge. To the eye, when you're up in those hills, 
it's all there, in its entirety. But try and catch what is there. As a 
single yet shifting entity, then, Edinburgh provides an obvious 
immediacy of solidity and flux, permanence and variegation in 
terms of geography, history and architecture. Indeed, the place 
might also be defined through the ever-changing quality of its 
light, where the self-same vista can be entirely transmogrified in 
atmosphere and character in the space of minutes, sometimes 
seconds. But especially to the writer, the life of the place is even 
more intensely channeled through its language. Shaped by its 
hills, I've often wondered if the place looks, from above, like a 
mouth. Certainly, it lives, noisily, through many mouths.</p> 

<p id="p16">Entrenched and widening material inequality is an obvious 
reality in Edinburgh, as in most places. But in at least some parts 
of the city, the way in which differing classes overlap makes 
this a pervasive reality, rather than something entirely photo-
shopped out of the coffee-shop existence of its civic life. It has 
its ghettoes, of course, dispiritingly marginalized to the edge of 
town, as well as its protected fine spots for the fabulous few.</p> 


</page>
<page number="11" proc="no">
	

<p id="p17">But in certain parts of the city differing classes still stack the 
same streets together. And this is something one hears, first and 
foremost, leading to a particularly vibrant oral life. The middle 
class and the poorer class each have distinct way of talking 
in Edinburgh, and both are wonderful. Add to this the verbal 
diversity brought by its many welcome visitors (a fifth of the 
city's population, at any one time, are students) and immigrants, 
and you are left with a brilliant Babel. To sit on a bus and listen 
to the chatter, in Edinburgh, is a wonder for the health of any 
prospective poet. The many-tongued murmuration of the city is 
a deep song for the ear.</p> 

<p id="p18">On top of this, there is the matter of style. Edinburgh 
has its own backstory of competing literary styles, the usual 
penumbra of 'experimental' versus 'traditional', and so on. The 
contributors to this book hail from widely differing stylistic 
corners of the city of literature, as well as from differing physical 
places. And the resulting eclecticism found within these covers 
most truly reflects the life of writing, in this city and in Scotland 
more generally. A cornucopia of style just about sums the place 
up. Whether indigenous or international, it doesn't matter: the 
seventy writers in this book have listened, looked, felt deeply 
and applied their craft. Whether passing through, or here for 
generations, each writer has added to the poetry of the place. 
What follows is a perfect new volume for a contemporary 
Edinburgh – one book, many worlds; an abundance of places  / 
within one space.

<p id="p19">Scotland's capital is a vibrant, diverse and modern city, 
cultivated by people from around the world. It's filled with 
cutting edge art, international cuisines, theatres and pubs, 
bright minds and masonry, dark side streets and sinister stories. 
Edinburgh is a hub for literary inspiration and ambition, 
hosting the world's largest literary festival, and it's the world's 
first UNESCO City of Literature. But pick up a collection of 
writing about Edinburgh, and you're often faced with the same 
list of names: dead white men.</p>

<p id="p20">Robert Burns, Walter Scott and Hugh MacDiarmid (et 
al) deserve their place in anthologies and history books, but 
modern Edinburgh has so much more to offer its contemporary 
readers. Edinburgh evolves, and those changes are embodied 
in the city's literature. Our hope for this book as editors, then, 
is to provide new ways of looking at Scotland's capital, to offer 
a mouthpiece for its assorted voices.</p>

<p id="p21">Why an anthology of writing? Well, we believe that 
anthologies are important: they capture a sense of place and 
the concerns of their time, bringing together perspectives and 
voices to better express things that might otherwise be ignored. 
The kaleidoscopic views present in anthologies act to build a 
more intricate and prismatic picture than that which we might 
see from a single author.</p> 

<p id="p22">As editors, we were keen to reflect the diversity of 
Edinburgh and its people, and to shift the existing (dead white 
men) focus through a more contemporary lens. This anthology 
includes work from writers of colour, writers who identify 
as LGBTQIA+, who live with disabilities, writers who have 
lived in countries other than Scotland, and its contributors 
predominantly identify as women.</p>  

<p id="p23">Our brief to the writers was simple: choose a location in 
Edinburgh (from a verly long list!) and write about it. Between</p> 


</page>
<page number="14" proc="no">

<p id="p24">these pages you'll find explorations of architecture, fragments 
of memories, views of potential futures, romps in hedgerows, 
summer picnics, hard winters, love, loss and the moments in 
between. These poems and short stories show us that the city 
is inseparable from its people, and it's the voices of our times 
which add colour and meaning to the brickwork. But it also 
shows us that Edinburgh is still a great source of inspiration 
for its inhabitants and those who pass through it; it takes them 
on journeys, through which the people and the city are forever  / 
altered.

moss-glorious trees, whatever wild neglected garden  / 
seen from the street, my favorite kind of beauty.</p>

<p id="p27">Enough said, I guess. All the alas and what not  / 
in that city. A few graves, an iron gate / 
as we stood there, and our bus  / 
flares up, stops, wheezing open its doors near an old  / 
was-it-a-church? Same late afternoon, same / 
sepia light, stones mortared with smaller stones to  / 
finish a wall in gloom so far  / 
gone ago. The ordinary is strange— / 
duh!--a mash-up.  / 
Zone then. Zone now. Zone everlasting, any century  / 
workmen calling it quits, stalking off  / 
for a pint and bangers and mash, more of this world /

<p id="p28">Well. Which is to say we were / 
up that double decker in a flash, at one with mouthy /

<p id="p114">Arlene was a boakey kid. Anytime she was tipped off her xy 
axes she was likely to land her last half-digested meal in the lap 
of whichever adult was scrubbing her face clean with a hankie 
or dragging her along by the arm. Other things set her off too. 
The path of the telegraph line spooling past the back window 
of the car.</p> 

<p id="p115">Swoop. Swoop. 
That would do it. Something about the way it sagged down 
then got hitched up like a dragging school sock by the pylon. 
Over and over and over and blaaaaaaah.</p> 

<p id="p116">Family legend had it that she threw up in the hood of her 
dad's parka once, when he was driving.</p> 

<p id="p117">I told you I needed out Dad.
This time the thrum of the wheels under her seat on the 
train had vibrated its way up through her legs and bum. It got 
into her low down belly and though she'd fought it and done all 
the breathing, it had crept into her high up belly. Her high up 
belly was already twitchy - like somebody waiting to get tickled. 
Arlene couldn't spell bronchial asthma but she'd had it since 
she was two. She'd been wheezy last night. Mum given her two 
spoonfuls of medicine in the early hours of the morning and 
she'd woken at breakfast time with her hands shaking and her 
eyes all juddery. Mum said it was adrenalin. She couldn't spell 
adrenalin either. And she could never eat her toast when she 
had the mediciney shakes.</p> 

<p id="p118">The train had went thrumrumthrumrumthrumrum until 
she was fighting sickness off in waves. If she was jostled getting 
into her coat or dunted on the way off the train she'd coup. But 
Paw Paw and Pom Pom walked her carefully into Waverley's</p>

<p id="p119">main thoroughfare, one of them on either side. Paw Paw's big 
hand between her shoulders. Her cousin Rhona rolled her eyes 
and called her a jessie but then she strode in front of the three 
of them pretending to be the Green Cross man, with her hands 
on her hips and her legs wide apart like a big X, putting a 
policeman hand up to folk in their path to stop them coming 
near, even grown ups.</p>

<p id="p120">Stop! Look! Listen! she told them.
Pom Pom told her to stop. 
In an American accent, Rhona said I'm a Handful ma'am. 
Just doin ma jawb.</p>

<p id="p121">Rhona was always a Handful and she was absolutely 
positively a Handful today. She was excited to be in Edinburgh. 
Her and Arlene were both double double excited to be there 
without their Mums or Dads.</p> 

<p id="p122">Paw Paw and Pom Pom would stop at good windows. They 
would let you have all the cakes from the top of the cake stand 
before having bread and butter from the bottom bit. They 
would buy you things without making you save up for some 
of it, so you knew the value of money. They didn't make you 
help out with dishes to earn it, or get something for your wee 
brother or sister so they didn't feel left out.</p> 

<p id="p123">Paw Paw and Pom Pom just bought you stuff because you 
fancied it.</p>

<p id="p124">Arlene's Mum and Rhona's Mum both said when they were 
out with Paw Paw and Pom Pom they were Spoilt Ruined.</p>

<p id="p125">Rhona bounced up and down in the middle of the busy 
station. She pulled the hood of her anorak up and hauled at the 
cords around until it shut like a fishing net and her nose stuck 
out the tiny wee hole. She wiggled her body and shot her feet 
out in an excited tap dance.</p>

<p id="p126">Arlene felt a bit better. Pom Pom was going to get her a hat. 
And a scarf. And maybe some gloves if they saw something  / 
that went. / 
It was much colder than Carnoustie.</p>

<p id="p127">Rhona puffed air out her mouth. It made smoke.
Arlene! Arlene look! I'm a train!
Pom Pom rolled her eyes. 
You're a blether
Paw Paw said, Here. Better no waste a good reek, and gave 
her an unlit Capstan Full Strength out his packet.</p>

<p id="p128">Rhona posed like Diana Dors, sucking on the fag and 
blowing a sigh of steam out of her mouth.</p> 

<p id="p129">My eye but I was needing that, she said, the exact same 
way Pom Pom did when she sat down at the kitchen table after 
cleaning the house. Pom Pom flicked her hand out and skiffed 
her on the back of the head.</p> 

<p id="p130">Paw Paw's laugh was so like Mutley the Dog on Catch The 
Pigeon it made Arlene's asthma hurt just hearing it. Heh heh 
heh heh</p>

<p id="p131">Dinnae encourage her John.
Arlene looked up past Pom Pom's red winter hat. Up and 
more up. Like a circus tent. So high. She could almost see 
a sparkly lady on a swing up there. Between the grey struts 
and arches of iron. Swoop. Swoop. Oh no. Don't swoop. Don't 
boak.</p>

<p id="p132">Arlene's dad worked at the Foundry Ironworks. He poured 
boiling hot metal into casts to make things like the station roof. 
Little girls weren't allowed in the foundry but one day when 
she was big enough he would take her to the Supervisor's 
window so she could look down and see the fire and the lava 
and the sparks.</p> 

<p id="p133">The station sounded like the foundry too. Waves of noise. 
Loudspeakers going wah, wah and not really words. Banging 
and whistles. People all busy.</p>

<p id="p134">She saw a pigeon fetutter down from the ceiling. A ravel of 
feathers. It stole a biscuit right out a wee boy's hand.</p>

<p id="p135">Her head got yanked to the side when Rhona pulled her 
hood. She breathed more hot puffs of steam in Arlene's ear.  / 
We're in Edinburgh!</p>

<p id="p136">I know! she whispered back.
Ladies and Gentlemen! - The Amazing Arlene and Rhona 
are Going To The Big Shops! Thrills and Spills Ladies and 
Gentlemen! Thriiiiills and Spiiiiills!</p> 

<p id="p137">Rhona was a big fan of Evel Knievel. 
C'mon you Gigglers. Pom Pom was wrapping her red 
scarf around her neck almost up to her lipstick. We've to get to 
Markies. Mon.</p>

<p id="p138">Paw Paw said, Is that the direction you're heading? Princes 
Street?</p>

<p id="p139">Aye. The lassies need woolies.
Right. Right ye are.
What?
Arlene and Rhona are in Paw Paw's coat pocket looking for 
his poke of liquorice bullets.</p>

<p id="p140">Well, I mentioned to Davey I'd be in toon. There's the Vittlers 
next week and he wants to talk to me aforehand. I thoucht I'd 
maybe nick up and see him, seeing as we're here.</p>

<p id="p141">John The
 Vittlers were boring. Paw Paw and Uncle Ally had a 
pub. On the wall of their pub was a certificate in a frame saying 
John Anderson Strachan and Alasdair Littlejohn Strachan were 
Scottish Licensed Victuallers. It meant they'd passed a test to 
be a good person from the Licensing Board. They could sell 
liquor.</p> 

<p id="p142">Liquor. 
Like in a cowboy saloon. 
Every time the licensing board was due, and a lot of times 
when it wasn't, there was a Vittlers meeting. Sometimes they 
had Vittler meetings even on holidays. Vittlers today was Bad.</p>

<p id="p143">The girls stood together silently, being Very Good. Arlene's 
stomach twisted on the inside.</p> 

<p id="p144">The golden day of cakes and treats and hats and scarves in 
Markies could disappear like steam if Paw Paw was meeting a 
Vittler. The Vittlers all smelled of gin and whisky and fag reek.</p>

<p id="p145">They laughed really loud and pinched your cheeks too hard. 
And they spoke for ages and ages, waving their glass or their 
fag about, while you made one packet of crisps and a lemonade 
last forever.</p> 

<p id="p146">Pom Pom was moving her mouth like she was trying to get 
toffee off her false teeth.</p> 

<p id="p147">Och cheer up Clara. Bona fide travellers and aw that. I'll 
no be all day.</p>

<p id="p148">He looked down at Arlene, the word gannet. Always asking 
if she didn't know because that's what she'd been telt to do.</p>

<p id="p149">We're travellers she said. 
We are that
We came from Carnoustie just now. 
We did
What's bonny fie dee Paw Paw? 
Well, it's French Ah think. It means real. Real honest to 
God travellers.</p> 

<p id="p150">Like us?
Just like us. And do you know what? It used to be that you 
couldnae get a drink on a Sunday in Scotland unless you were 
a bona fide traveler and had come at least 3 and half mile for 
it. Is that no awful?</p> 

<p id="p151">Aye
Imagine that eh?
Rhona said, Could you get water?
Oh aye. But you couldnae get a drink drink.
Pom Pom was a dark floating cloud of silence somewhere 
above their heads. She grabbed their nearest shoulder a bit 
more firmly than it needed. They were too big to run away. 
Her handbag slid down her arm and dunted Rhona.</p>

<p id="p152">Right you two. Princes Street. Up aw those steps.
Now haud on, said Paw Paw
What? What for? What would we haud on for? Pom Pom 
said.
Paw Paw smacked his pockets, checking for his wallet as if</p>

<p id="p153">he was a wee bit worried it might have crawled off and hidden 
somewhere. Then he went, Ah! when he found it where it 
always was. He took out a note, folded it along it's length and, 
looking Arlene in the eye, he raised an eyebrow and offered it 
to her from between his middle and his pointing finger. For all 
the world like a gambler buying more chips from the dealer in 
a casino.</p>

<p id="p154">Arlene took it and said Thank you very quietly
John. That's far too much.
Och now. 
He looked at the lassies
That's for sharing, he said. Then he was John Wayne. 
Straight down the middle pardners, ya hear?</p>

<p id="p155">Rhona said Thank you Paw Paw and flung herself around 
his waist.</p>

<p id="p156">Pom Pom tuts. Grabs Rhona's hand.
C'mon. Arlene put that away where you won't lose it for 
Chrissake.</p> 

<p id="p157">She takes Arlene's other hand and they move through the 
people to the foot of the steps up to Princes Street and Markies 
and the woolly hats.</p>

<p id="p158">They hear Paw Paw in the crowd over the wah wah speaker 
and the bangs and the whistles, shouting cheerfully he'll see 
them back at the train.</p>

<p id="p159">Pom Pom's shiny black clumpy heels hit the stone floor like 
a flamenco dancer and they run skip to keep up.</p> 

<p id="p160">The steps are steep like a mountain. Really really like a 
mountain. Arlene would like a rope round her waist tied to 
Pom Pom up ahead. There's a postcard of blue and white sky 
in the distance, way at the top. The steps don't match. Some 
are concrete. Some are made of shiny stuff with sparkly bits in, 
like the floor of the station. Some are disgusting and slidey and 
mossy green and made of gravestone stone. Some are broken. 
The crush of people bounce off the lassies and keep forcing 
them to let go of the hand rail. Rhona says Hey! Mind out!</p>

<p id="p161">and walks in front of Arlene saying S'cuse me, s'cuse me to 
folk coming toward them until Pom Pom tells her to stop her 
nonsense.</p>

<p id="p162">They lift their feet nearly waist high it feels like. Giant steps. 
Feeling the promise of Princes Street and the blue white fresh 
air in front of them and the deep open mouth of the station 
falling away behind. Wah wah. Wah wah.</p>

<p id="p163">The smells change in gusts and puffs. Macaroni and 
cheese, pipe smoke, aftershave, wet metally steam, mould. 
They're about half way up when Arlene gets a whiff of the sick 
in a corner and just like that she's boakey again.</p> 

<p id="p164">Pom Pom! Pom Pom I'm gonna be sick! 
In one movement Pom Pom gathers Arlene's hair back out 
the way and spins her to face the wall. She stands behind her 
and puts an arm round the bairn's waist, lifting her up and 
away from the splattery mess she's making and holding her 
clear until she's done.</p>

<p id="p165">Then she puts her down well out the way of it all and takes 
out a pile of hankies. Pom Pom's mouth goes like a pulled 
thread while she scrubs Arlene's face clean and checks her 
front for mess.</p> 

<p id="p166">Better?
Uh - huh. I'm sorry. I had too.
It's awright chickie. No harm done.
Pom Pom pats her on the bum twice and hooks her handbag 
hand into Rhona's.</p> 

<p id="p167">C'mon you two. Onward and upwards.
The hat she got was amazing. Like a big blue squashy  / 
strawberry.</p>

For it is uisge beatha all the way to the sea.
A running of rocks.
A tangle of trees
knotted to the banks.
A halt for Mister Heron who waits Confucian, an ageless 
silk-screen print who knows his tide will turn.
Worn thin and less befeathered than he was before
he has perfected still life, just by the steps that lead 
to Modern Art.
He reflects on the pool
where it widens out
before the rapid rush.
And loved ones stigmatized before by old ignorance 
are remembered here on wrought-iron bench and stone 
and a gathering of hearts.
Mallards catch the spring drift, watch their new brood
learn the splash and float and paddle. The dipping curiosity / 
and thrill of weed and worm. / 
The thwack of tennis back  / 
and forth on the far side / 
accompanies the summer pech and grunt of Murray / 
aspiration. And under Mr Telford's bridge there is  / 
a quernstone, gritty with the memory of grain.</p>

<p id="p175">Ignored by joggers and the cyclists sleek with lycra 
on their ride to work, tourists ooh and aah, enchanted 
with this unexpected winding wilderness. Tended 
and tamed, but not 
too often or too much. 
Each stroll is singular. 
Paved with autumn, crisped with frost or squelched 
with an excess of rain. Today the path and its companion
snake unruly.
But there is a melting in this March-bound air that irrigates
the city's breath. Catches sun-shafts, the flicker-dance 
of rising light which
etches pale shadows.
Celandines are stirring.
Hoardes of bluebells will soon begin to read the score 
that dangles every note of their being. And moon-flecks / 
will foam the sea as she is drawn in to meet  / 
the kindred longing of water.

Apologies and singing children, /

Our bond of motherhood – a mound of Lionesses, /

<p id="p256">A Man's a Man for A' That.
Lothian Road.
Douglas Bruton.</p>

<p id="p257">Nobody don't pay him no heed. Not unless it's to look away 
or to quicken their step, or maybe to cross to the other side of 
Lothian Road like they was on the wrong side all along – some 
of them do that.</p> 

<p id="p258">Nobody looking at him, unless it's the little girl holding onto 
her mammy's hand, and her hair's in tight pigtails, and she's 
knee high to a grasshopper, and from behind her mammy's 
coat-tails she dares to peek. And the girl knows it's rude to 
stare, been told often enough, but she does it anyway – stares 
at the man with his hair all shocked and tangled and torn, and 
his hoddin gray army coat that's seen better days, reaching 
almost to the ground and it's tied closed with old string, and 
his scuffed forever-lost-their-shine boots tied just the same. 
And he smiles, doesn't he now, and his smile is broken and 
gap-toothed and black, but it is a smile all the same and so the 
little girl gives him back an uncertain smile of her own.</p>

<p id="p259">The man, old as hills or history books, holds a plastic cup 
in one hand, reaching for pennies, or pounds if he's in luck. 
He shakes it to show how little he has and it makes a music 
of sorts. And the girl, well, hasn't she a penny in her pocket? 
And she wants to add it to his music, but her mammy pulls 
her quickly near and then as quickly away without looking at 
the man.</p>

<p id="p260">His name is Tam. He peers up at the blue of the sky, so blue 
it almost hurts, and Tam's face is lifted like he might be an Old 
Testament prophet speaking with God, and he says a prayer of 
sorts and counts his blessings, such as they are. It is not cold 
today and it is not wet and the air is still instead of sting. In 
his cup he calculates he has enough already for a cup of tea,</p> 


</page>
<page number="71" proc="no">

<heading>55</heading>

<p id="p261">hot and with a wee drop milk and two heaped sugars thank 
you dear, and a bit of change left over. Maybe the woman in 
the take-out coffee shop will feel sorry for him and he'll get a 
sandwich with his tea. Her name's Kitty and her bark is worse 
than her bite.</p>

<p id="p262">Down at the bottom of the road, close enough he can hear 
the bells of the new trams, and there's a man standing in front 
of the Carlton Hotel. He's maybe as tall as a door and as broad, 
and he holds himself stiff and straight. He wears a hat with a 
glassy peak like something an officer in the army might wear. 
And his maroon coloured coat is edged with yellow braid and 
the buttons are brassy like gowd, and he's got white gloves on 
his hands, pure and white as nurses' aprons.</p> 

<p id="p263">''Morning, Tam,' he says, and he touches the peak of his 
cap, touching with the pinch of finger and thumb of one hand. 
Like a salute it is, or like he might be about to remove the hat 
or tip it, but just touching and then dropping his hand fast to 
his side again. 'How's it going?' he says.</p>

<p id="p264">Tam holds his arms out wide, as he would if he was about 
to embrace the doorman or the whole world, and he turns in 
a shuffling and imperfect circle, and his smile is as full as his 
smile can be, and his eyes glint.</p> 

<p id="p265">The doorman of the Carlton Hotel nods and he laughs. 
Then he puts one hand into the deep pocket of his coat and he 
pulls out a spilling handful of change. It is all copper and bit 
silver. He leans towards Tam and lets the money slide from his 
palm into Tam's cup.</p>

<p id="p266">'You go canny now, see,' the doorman says, and he winks 
at Tam. Then, remembering his place, he darts forward, quick 
and easy, and he opens the door of a taxi that has just pulled 
up, and he helps out a woman in fine clothes, her silken hair 
all bobbed and bowed, and the tinsel show of rings on all her 
fingers – and who knows, maybe on her toes, too.</p>

<p id="p267">The doorman takes the woman's bag, waves the taxi away 
imperiously, and ushers the woman protectively towards the</p> 


</page>
<page number="72" proc="no">

<heading>56</heading>

<p id="p268">entrance of the hotel, passing some sweet nothing pleasantry 
with her about the day and formally welcoming the woman to 
the Carlton Hotel, Edinburgh.</p>

<p id="p269">Tam shakes his cup. The music is a little heavier now and he 
feels certain he has enough for a sandwich with his cup of tea, 
even if Kitty at the shop is in a surly and sullen mood. He spins 
in a circle again, his arms flung out like he could be in flight. A 
pigeon, blood in its eye and startled by Tam's pirouette, takes to 
the sudden and ruffled air.</p>

<p id="p270">Tam checks the time on the fancy clock on the corner of 
Frasers. It didn't used to be called Frasers. It had a different 
name before but he can't now remember what that was even 
though he met a girl there once, outside the shop, on a Saturday 
closing-time-night, and the street lit up yellow, and it was an 
arrangement they had – it was an arrangement a lot of young 
men had with their girls back then. Tam was to take his girl to 
the pictures but her bus was late and so they went for a drink 
at The Rutland instead. She drank Babycham bubbles out of 
a champagne glass and he had a pint of heavy and the man 
behind the bar winked at him and grinned as if they was friends.</p> 

<p id="p271">The clock says it's past ten. Tam tips half the money out of 
his cup and pockets it. He knows it does no good to be shaking 
a full cup, that no one's going to give him pennies or pounds if 
his cup looks like he has enough to be going on with. He turns 
on his heel and heads back up Lothian Road, feeling the pull.</p>

<p id="p272">There's the Usher Hall now with its dome all green and 
pretty. And it's different these days. They've done it up modern 
with a great glass box stuck on one side. And the stone's been 
cleaned up nice when it used to be black as soot or blot. Tam 
wonders if he could be cleaned up the same and what it would 
mean if he was. There's a woman at the shelter he has a softness 
for. Perhaps if he was a bit cleaner she'd kiss him if he dared 
to ask, or with one hand she'd be stroking his cheek or fiddling 
in his trouser pockets and not looking for change or keys or  / 
cigarettes.</p>


</page>
<page number="73" proc="no">

<heading>57</heading>

<p id="p273">'Do you love me?' she might say, and he'd say he does, he 
really does.</p>

<p id="p274">Tam laughs then and it is the sound of crows calling or a dog 
barking. He shakes his head and he sets off on his way, walking 
with some small and new found purpose, for he will take his 
tea and sandwich to a corner of the Meadows on this fine day. 
There's a space there that he thinks belongs to him, just as he 
thinks all of Edinburgh belongs to him, and why does it not? 
From his place on the Meadows he can see the castle above the 
buildings where the hospital used to be, and off to one side the 
crouching and sleeping lion of Arthur's Seat, and everywhere 
the rolling green slopes of the Meadows with trees reaching to 
the sky and well-trodden paths criss-crossing the park, all of 
them going somewhere and nowhere. And seagulls there are, 
dancing on the close-cropped grass, making a small dishonest 
thunder under their yellow feet that brings the fearful-of-
drowning worms to the surface same as if it was rain that was 
falling. And daffodils that briefly crowded in corners, nodding 
their bright and golden heads, have turned over, and Spring 
coories up to Summer, and children turn gleeful cartwheels 
across the park, their arms and their legs thrown wide so they 
could be fallen stars; and Tam stretches out on the grass, lying 
on his back, like he is in a great bed. He could be anyone then 
and he could be anywhere.</p>

<p id="p275">Once there was a girl lying beside him on the grass, years 
back now, years on years and too many for counting. He closes 
his eyes and remembers. He thinks maybe it was the same girl 
that also drank Babycham bubbles in The Rutland bar – maybe 
it was another girl. She was helping him learn irregular verbs in 
German: ist, war, gewesen. He loved her then and he told her as 
much. The sky was blue, like it is today only more blue, as blue 
as it only ever is in memory, and the sun was warm on his face.</p>

<p id="p276">'Do you?' she said. 'Do you love me?' And there was gentle 
mockery in her sing-song voice.
Tam rolled over and looked her in the face, pretty as peaches.</p>

<page number="74" proc="no">

<heading>58</heading>

<p id="p277">'I really do,' he said. And he was in earnest as only the young 
can be, or maybe also the old when they remember. 'Really I 
do.'</p>

<p id="p278">'Now you do,' she said. 'But come tomorrow…'
Tam did not believe in forever. Not back then. He was just 
a boy after all and back then he only believed in the here and 
the now, but he told her again that he loved her and he told her 
that he would love her for all the tomorrows that might be left 
to them. She sang the words of a Beatles song, something about 
getting older and being 64 and would he still be sending her a 
valentine. Tam said he'd love her then, too, when she was old 
and he was old and they were both old. She'd laughed.</p>

<p id="p279">Tam lies on his back, as rich as any man could be. In one 
hand he holds a plastic cup of tea with a plastic lid, a wee drop 
milk and two sugars thank you very much, and in the other 
hand a ham and cheese sandwich, white bread with butter, cut 
neat into triangles. With his eyes closed everything is the same – 
ist, war, gewesen: is, was, and shall be. He hears again the sound 
of children at play, a dog barking with no bite, and somewhere 
the ring of a bicycle bell.</p>

<p id="p280">She must be near to old now, he thinks, that gently mocking 
girl, and Tam wonders where she is and he wonders if she 
thinks of him sometimes. Her name comes to him sudden, and 
he whispers her name, gives shape to it in breath, so soft that no 
one else hears, soft as grass whispers.</p>

<p id="p281">And about him seagulls dance their timeless dance on the 
rising and falling slopes, and the stretching-tall trees stand on 
tiptoe as they always have, arms spread wide to embrace the 
sky; and somewhere near, so near Tam can hear, another boy 
tells a different girl that he loves her, he really does, and the girl 
laughs as they always do, and this time Tam laughs too, and he 
cries also, and no one notices that he does, or if they do then 
they look away again thinking the old man maybe drunk or  / 
mad or stupid.</p>

<p id="p324">A Beltane Prayer.
Calton Hill.
Laura Clay.</p>

<p id="p325">The starkness of the bitter, wind-chilled spring was always a 
surprise to Fiona when she left her flat and returned to these 
streets: the same rough paving slabs on which she'd worn out 
countless childhood shoes, traipsing to school. A few years 
ago, the tower block had carried the joyful mixture of family 
meals and the sound of laughter, magnified to a multitude in the 
stairwell. Now, there was only the pungent combination of stale 
cigarettes and the persistent damp, its tendrils marking the dull 
concrete around it. Here was the threshold between night and 
day, watched over by politicians in their distant plywood towers. 
As Fiona left for her errands, she passed a harried office worker, 
tapping out a harsh staccato in her heels. The only constant, 
unchanging part of her home was the rough feel of the wall 
under Fiona's fingertips, the curve of the staircase up to the 
tenth floor. It was a regular, Brutalist kind of magic, the sort that 
the rarified air of the New Town couldn't touch with its elegant 
austerity.</p>

<p id="p326">Soot-stained, haphazard buildings crowded around Fiona 
when she finally reached the heart of the Old Town. Sometimes, 
it smelled like it was still a meat market, and it was best not to 
question what was running down the gutter in sullen streams 
beside her. As soon as the familiar chaos of the Grassmarket 
crept into her ears, she felt herself relax.</p>

<p id="p327">On that first honeymoon day in Edinburgh, when everything 
had felt a little brighter, she'd taken her husband to the outdoor 
market, excitedly pointing at all the ingredients she remembered 
from her parents' meals. The stall holder handed over a golden 
shard of ginger, the ragged edges hinting at the fire contained 
within. Fiona breathed in its earthy, almost wooden smell. Her</p> 


</page>
<page number="95" proc="no">

<heading>79</heading>

<p id="p328">mother would set the gnarled root on the kitchen worktop, and 
as she cut it open the room would be filled with that pungent 
fragrance, demanding the cook's full attention. There would 
always be a few pieces left over from the dinner pot for Fiona, 
though. A tentative nibble would cause a narrowing of the eyes, 
a tickle in the throat, and her siblings' mockery. Over the years, 
that piquancy became a comfort, a reminder of those dinners 
together, and its fleshy firmness a memory of her family's warm 
embrace.</p>

<p id="p329">Fiona left the market laden with bags of spices, and found 
herself turning upwards towards the throngs on the Royal 
Mile. A woman bumped into Fiona with her pram; she gave an 
involuntary flinch when she saw it, but shook away the memory 
and walked on. Among the tourist tat shops, she found the 
small jewellers where she had bought the luckenbooth charm. 
Two hearts were still intertwined in the shop window, the silver 
gleaming in the fading light. For a moment she stood there, 
oblivious to the open-mouthed shoals of tourists flowing around 
her, and watched an old lady rearrange the display around the 
charm. Fiona's hands found their way to her neck, and she traced 
a finger around the outline of the hearts. Its magic hadn't been 
enough. She'd held his hand all that night ten years ago, and he'd 
given her the luckenbooth when he drew his last breath.</p>

<p id="p330">A salty tang from the Forth tinged the air when Fiona 
returned home and began the climb to her flat. A dozen storeys 
made the bags of shopping seem as heavy as her memories. 
The kitchen was her favourite room, because she could watch 
the volcano sleeping while she cooked, imagining the steamed 
windows were the result of its furious eruption, or the breath of 
the creatures that she knew dwelled beneath it.</p>

<p id="p331">Fiona thought it was perfect witchcraft, the way Arthur's 
Seat lay in the middle of the city, often mist-clad, watching over 
the quiet contest between Old and New Town. The fight was 
there in every street. She knew about the other battles that most 
people couldn't see; it was both a power and a burden her family</p> 


</page>
<page number="96" proc="no">

<heading>80</heading>

<p id="p332">had had to bear through the centuries.</p>

<p id="p333">When the mixture was cooked, Fiona opened the window 
and leaned out, letting the evening wind blow her long grey hair 
back. Soon it would be time to leave again. The bright yellow 
flames of gorse hanging over the doorway shed some of their 
petals as she brushed past them. She still kept the dried wedding 
bouquet, dotted with faded flowers from the wild bushes around 
town, in a box next to the empty, pristine cot.</p>

<p id="p334">The volcano's shadow crept along the grass of Holyrood 
Park, following Fiona as she approached the sheltered spot 
where the ceremony would take place. It was a custom she had 
observed every year since her husband had died, far from the 
rest of the crowds on Calton Hill drinking away the last hours 
before summer brought a bright renewal to the city.</p>

<p id="p335">A pall of smoke hung over the distant Beltane celebrations, 
dwarfing the bonfire Fiona had lit in a ring of stones before her. 
Inside her satchel, she'd brought more bunches of yellow flowers, 
a flask of pungent gingery broth, and an oatmeal bannock. On 
her way out, she'd run into the kindly old gentleman who lived 
next door; he had laughed and said 'it's a wee bit cold for a 
picnic at your age'. Still, he took the spare oatcake gratefully, not 
realising the power in her offering.</p>

<p id="p336">The fire crackled, sparks leaping upwards to join the stars. 
Fiona opened the flask and poured half of the broth onto the 
dark earth, an offering to the fairy folk living in the mound 
there. A bush rustled nearby and she stopped, turning round. 
Nobody had discovered her small rituals yet; most of the people 
she passed in the street were too ground down by their own 
worries to even notice the city around them. A rabbit scurried 
from the undergrowth and Fiona let out the breath she was 
holding, a cloud of mist gathering around her face.</p>

<p id="p337">She laid out her patchwork coat on the grass and sat down, 
watching the fire die down. Years of the same routine, and years 
of the same wait, alone in a city of thousands. Fiona looked up at 
the stars, more visible now that she was further from the orange</p>

dead shall surely grow. That was the prayer being offered by the 
revellers gathered on the hill, their faces painted bright spring 
colours.</p>

<p id="p339">Eyes closed, Fiona felt the air turn warmer. He was late 
again. The grass rustled, as if someone was sitting down next 
to her. She opened her eyes and saw his broad shoulders, thick 
red beard and smiling eyes. Before Fiona could say anything, a  / 
familiar voice drifted to her ears. / 
'It's not long now. You'll see me soon.' / 
She closed her eyes again and smiled.</p>

St Andrew Square.
Jock Stein.</p>

<p id="p360">Tangled rod ends dangle in their metal webs, 
no longer able to conceal their reinforcement
of the hard core guts of money making
in this once rich square. High cranes take days
to launder work space, disengage blue cladding,
grab at rubbish concrete with their jagged jaws,
worrying it like a dog, dropping it in clouds
of dust controlled by well-aimed water sprays.
Such rough treatment of two million hours
of history… on his column, Viscount Melville 
notices and gives an angry cough: first trams,
and now a shopping mall, what next, a helipad?
Is this the distant fruit of that enlightened brilliance
which propelled us to pan-European heights?
Or is it more the slow unpicking of Establishment,
so should we click at once on 'like', or be heart-sad?
The Square began with Dundas House, which soon became
the Royal Bank head office, with its hall and features
starring in some banknotes still in circulation.
The British Linen Bank was built upon its flanks
in 1806, and taken over by the Bank of Scotland.
The Union bank (now RBS) then gobbled up
the National Bank; with a sense of dèja vu we ask,
'They regulate their clients… who regulates the banks?'</p>

Scottish Provident sold their Life Assurance first
in 1837. Their actuaries ruled like kings, and
one chipped daily golf balls from his office window
perfectly onto the grassy centre, till his status
changed from mild celebrity to minor criminal.
Spot on the Millennium, Abbey bought them over,
asset stripped them, took the loot to Glasgow
dodging history's question: 'Just how will they rate us?'
And where is old St Andrew in this pilgrimage of fame?
How does he match young Vincent Street and Charlotte Square,

The Fruitmarket Gallery.
Rob A MacKenzie.
(during Phyllida Barlow's 'Set' exhibition, summer 2015).</p>

<p id="p365">Tottering piles of planks! Paint-splattered cardboard
at improbable angles! The guinea pig has never known 
such static contingency, such resistance to collapse
among the already collapsed. It owes its life to fear
of sudden movement, intricate shifts, cul-de-sacs. 
It complains of an irresponsible lack of balance 
between boulders, between choices. The guinea pig
has significant doubts over risk-free concepts of
stability. One twitch of a nose and a galaxy somewhere  / 
sparks into quarks. It scents danger over light years of / 
darkness. In the gallery café, Imogen froths flat white / 
artworks; Ed's beard, symbol of bacchanalian glamour, / 
stirs to independent life. Iain cements his reputation  / 
as a magnet for beautiful women. If things appear on / 
the slide, they hold true at root. If Edinburgh drinks  / 
itself upright, the guinea pig will nudge it slantwise. / 
No matter how quietly it sits within the red tarpaulin / 
bodybag, the city will never feel quite quiet enough.</p>

Calton Hill.
Ricky Monahan Brown.</p>

<p id="p443">I've borrowed a book of Edinburgh city walks from the library, 
to get my bearings back. This one takes me through the Old 
Calton Burial Ground, which Abraham Lincoln benevolently 
surveys from a plinth. His monument marks the graves of five 
Scots who died in the Civil War, all on the Union side.</p>

<p id="p444">Uncertain of the details of my journey after a long absence, 
I've been repeatedly taking my phone out of my pocket to check 
my progress. Edinburgh always claimed to be on seven hills, 
like Rome, its spiritual predecessor. Arthur's Seat, Blackford 
Hill, Braid Hills, Castle Hill, Corstorphine Hill, Craiglockart 
Hill, and the one I'm on now. Or maybe it's the seven in the 
old rhyme:</p>

<p id="p445">Abbey, Calton, Castle grand,
Southward see St Leonards stand,
St Johns and Sciennes as two are given,
And Multrees makes seven.
Or maybe the map in my pocket is right, and Edinburgh is 
really built on countless hills and under innumerable bridges, a 
labyrinthine rat run. But the Nelson Monument looms above, 
so I take a chance on my gut and head up a narrow, stone, 
tree-lined set of stairs signposted as "Jacob's Ladder". Because 
going with my gut always worked before, I wryly reflect.</p>

<p id="p446">Re-emerging into the light, I orient myself again. Horatio's 
561-foot telescope still stands on its end to the north, but a 
little closer now. Peering deep into Edinburgh's heart. So I 
cross Calton Road and set off up another flight of stone steps 
to the summit. Halfway up, a monk in grey robes and Reeboks</p>

a pen, indicating that I can fill in my name, home country, a 
message of peace, and a pledge. I fish in the pocket of my jeans 
for a pound coin, and the monk thanks me with another smile.</p>

<p id="p448">He indicates the little yellow flowers crowding into the 
stairway and tells me in quiet, halting English, 'When the gorse 
is in bloom, it is the kissing time.'</p>

<p id="p449">I smile back and nod.
When I reach the top of the hill, I smell the salty sea air 
blowing across the flat, open expanse of the park. I mark a 
cross on Calton Hill, and stuff the map back into my pocket. 
Above, a plane slices a contrail across the blue sky, having 
turned the shoulder of North Berwick.</p> 

<p id="p450">That was always my favourite part of the flight back from 
New York, seeing the harbours of Leith and Edinburgh laid 
out 5,000 feet below. Like the map I once poured across my 
parents' living room floor, tracing from where Mum fished me 
out of Newhaven harbour at low tide to where Paw watched 
as I righted myself after capsizing under the Forth Rail Bridge. 
But I never took that flight often enough. Not even after the 
desks at Cantor Fitzgerald, eighty floors above the desk of my 
late wife, were turned to dust. Dust that silted up the Hudson 
River, the Diamond Reef, and the lungs of New York City's 
rescue workers.</p> 

<p id="p451">Having taken a few breaths of recollection, I start towards 
the top of the monument. Just a few steps into the 143 
whitewashed stairs spiralling upward, the frame of a recessed 
window relays the message, Almost there.</p> 

<p id="p452">'How brilliantly Edinburgh!' I think. It's still inside me, 
twenty years later. Even now, when Chloë flies away to visit 
her parents in South Carolina, I can feel the petrifying stoicism  / 
spreading outwards again to cold fingers and toes.</p>

<p id="p453">Closer to the top of the tower, another message in neat 
black paint exhorts me to Keep going on! And I do. All the way 
to the thin door in time-traveling blue that, if two strangers 
push and pull it together, can be opened out onto a spectacular 
view over the National Monument, towards the Kingdom of 
Fife. The ships in the Forth contrast with the boats of the new 
Scottish Parliament lying keels-upward in the shadow of the 
tower, wishing their architect's Mediterranean sun could dry 
them out. The ships in the firth are alive and productive, like 
the fishing boats my grandfather's friends sailed. I think of 
him taking me to see Jimmy, who would lie on his waterbed 
in Seafield Hospital changing the channels on the television 
by blowing into an air pipe. The fisherman had broken his 
neck falling through an open hatch in the deck of his boat. 
The waterbed was to prevent bedsores, but Jimmy would let 
a fascinated wee boy up on it, too. Of course, I didn't see the 
tragedy. Only the excitement of the new, and the generous, 
garrulous fisherman. But now, the boats just remind me that 
Hugh and Jimmy are gone, and my mother, too. Back in Auld 
Reekie with my tail between my legs, taking this walk for the 
first time in in too long, it will take time for this to become a 
new version of home.</p>

<p id="p454">I bring my view back down to Edinburgh's Folly, the 
landmark I've really come to see. Since moving back, I've 
been walking around the city and re-learning its rhythms and 
routes. With Chloë in tow, I find myself taking unexpected, 
meandering detours that unveil new views, as well as more 
obvious, expository routes. Walking east along Princes Street, 
the gothic rocket ship of the Scott Monument hadn't looked as 
tall as it did back in the day. But it has a heft I don't remember. 
From there, Scotland's National Monument looked like it 
should be all the way down in Leith. Like its spiritual successor, 
the tram, it only gets as far as the East End.</p>

<p id="p455">Scanning the Folly from my telescopic aerie, I try to map 
for myself how the balance of Playfair and Cockerill's plans</p>

<page number="127" proc="no">

<heading>111</heading>

<p id="p456">for the monument might have lain. Particularly the catacombs 
that were intended, two hundred years ago, to form Scotland's 
Valhalla, a place where the nation's heroes would have been put 
to rest. A place where Jimmy and my grandfather might have 
been comfortable, after those wartime special operations in 
Albania and Malaysia. Not somewhere for a Scot who should 
have died three thousand miles away after a day spent eating 
fancy pizza, drinking, smoking, and shagging.</p>

<p id="p457">But I can't build the chambers from absence, so I tumble 
back down the narrow stairs of the tower to have a look from 
ground level. Down here, the Monument's few pillars are 
overwhelming, and I'm aware that it has acquired a power 
to move as a palimpsest that it could never have had in its 
complete state.</p>

<p id="p458">A caravan of Spanish tourists in bright anoraks is rolling 
down towards the road. As their laughter blows over Holyrood 
Park towards Duddingston Loch, it seems I've been left with 
the place to myself. I sit on a low rock and root myself down 
into the land. Eyes closed, I'm imagining the grass spreading 
over my boots and pulling me in. When I open my eyes again, 
I'm surprised to see a wee boy sitting atop the monumental 
steps. I walk over, and with effort haul myself up to join him.</p>

<p id="p459">He doesn't look like one of the Spaniards, this blond, ruddy-
cheeked laddie.</p>

<p id="p460">'Hullo.' His speech confirms it.
'Hello to you, wee man. How did you manage to get up 
here? I'm fair puggled.'</p>

<p id="p461">'The same way as you.'
That settles it, I suppose. The slightness of his frame must 
have compensated for those wiry little arms and legs.</p>

<p id="p462">'I like your cardie,' I tell him.
'Thanks. My mammy knitted it for me.'
We sit in silence for a moment, then he reaches into his 
pocket for a plastic toy. He presses a button to extend it into full 
operational mode, and waves it up and down my side. I squint.</p>

<heading>112</heading>


<p id="p463">'Don't worry,' the boy reassures me. 'The sonic screwdriver 
indicates that all your circatrigintan rhythms are normal.'</p>

<p id="p464">'That's a relief,' I tell the prodigy. 'But what's a circatrigintan 
rhythm when it's at home?'</p>

<p id="p465">He giggles and confesses he has no idea. It's a word he's 
heard his mother use.</p>

<p id="p466">'That's okay. Can I have a look at that?'
Appreciating the interest, the lad hands over the toy. I 
replicate his motions.</p>

<p id="p467">'Oh! Two hearts!' I exclaim. 'Are you Doctor Who?'
'No, but I am a Time Lord,' the lad explains with great 
emphasis, as if to a smaller child.</p>

<p id="p468">'Oh, good! I've been wanting to ask someone — I was 
watching a science program, and they said that time travel is 
possible, but only backwards. Is that right?'</p>

<p id="p469">'Oh, no!' he tells me. 'I can travel to the future, too. How 
else could I get back if I visited the past?'</p>

<p id="p470">I explain to him that I managed to travel to New York in 
the 1990s.</p>

<p id="p471">'Really? How did you get back here?' the Time Lord asks.
'I had to take the long way back.' 
That seems to satisfy him. The lad and I sit for a while, 
quiet, save for the muted thump of his trainers swinging against 
the stone steps. After a few minutes, I see Chloë heading along 
the path towards us, the Doric columns behind me and the boy 
scattering sunlight around her. Bang on time.</p>

<p id="p472">I turn back to him.
'Look, I know you're a Time Lord and all, but is your mum 
around?'</p>

<p id="p473">'Oh yes. She's down over the other side.'
'Good,' I reply, craning round to face where the catacombs 
would have been. I see the head of a woman giving her wee 
man just enough space to start exploring the world for himself.
'Robbie!' she calls. 'Leave the man alone. It's time to go  / 
home!'</p>

<heading>113</heading>

<p id="p474">'Is that your mum?' I stage whisper, conspiratorially.
The boy nods. Before he goes, I want to tell him that 
traveling backwards in time is really difficult, too. That if you 
don't get things right the first time, it's hard to go back and 
fix them. And if you find yourself holed up in hospital after 
being shot in a botched mugging in the West Village, you might 
not get to say all the things you want to say before your mum 
leaves.</p>

<p id="p475">But he doesn't need to know that yet. It's so beautiful up 
here today.</p>

<p id="p476">'OK. Look, before you go... I was bluffing when I said 
I didn't know much about time travel. I need you to take a 
message to your mum.</p>

<p id="p477">'You run over, and tell her that you met a traveller from 
the future, and that he told you that you're gonna do just fine.  / 
Alright?

<p id="p489">Redrawing The  Lines.
St. Giles Cathedral.
Keith Dumble.</p>

<p id="p490">It's the oldest one I could find.</p>

<p id="p491">Paper so thin it's more a memory than a map. Still 
recognisable though. Still fit for purpose. The Castle, a black 
fist atop broken bones of rock. Arthur's Seat a declawed lion, 
dreaming of its youth, of when it gouged the land into this 
blanket wrinkle of hills. Around the city, a wall, long since 
smashed by Edinburgh's unruly spurts of growth. Inside its 
protective boundary, individual houses stand confident side-
by-side, safety in numbers.</p>

<p id="p492">Perfect.
I concentrate. Focus my temporal lobe until the lines float 
up from the parchment, a ghost city shimmering above my 
desk. I wait until the mistplane is fully-formed, the summit of 
Arthur's Seat the last thing to solidify.</p>

<p id="p493">I sever my cord, swoop down. Down through the grim 
clouds of reality, down until the feet of my soul touch straw-
strewn streets. I gag against the meat-turned stench, so strong 
it bites at my inner cortex.</p>

<p id="p494">I take a moment to acclimatise, to avoid the swamping rush 
of overload. The voices I hear sound foreign; single, simple 
words are all I catch. I hear one – kirk – and grasp at it, clinging 
to its familiarity. Use it to pull myself in, deeper. Until I can 
bear to open my eyes.</p>

<p id="p495">The church stabs at heaven. It's older — and newer — 
than the one I know. Without its crowned spire, the refined 
architecture of the steeple appears to have mistaken the 
midden-muddle of Edinburgh for the more ordered streets of 
Rome or Florence. It disorients me for a moment; I think I've  / 
miscalculated. But no, it is St Giles.</p>


</page>
<page number="136" proc="no">

<heading>120</heading>


<p id="p496">I pull out for a moment, study the map. The hand-drawn 
cross on top of the church points to a line between two houses 
on the other side of the High Street. I spin a coin in my head, 
wait for it to stop. Tails it is. I choose the house on the left, 
the one with more markings. I drag myself back through the 
mistplane, back to the streets, back in front of the cathedral.</p>

<p id="p497">The object sits heavy in my pocket, each tick of its hands is 
a moment passing unmarked into history. I take it out, check 
it's still in one piece. The glass is solid, the intricate workings of 
the sphere inside throb with a mechanical heartbeat.</p>

<p id="p498">I cross the road, passing through a horse dragging a cart 
piled high with manure. The animal senses me, whinnying. 
The driver does not; he whips the beast and curses it using 
sharp-edged words I'm glad I don't understand.</p>

<p id="p499">The house I've chosen looms up like a cliff, with glassless 
windows like hermit's caves. The door hangs on one hinge; a 
smear-faced child lolls on the doorstep, playing with a piece 
of wood carved into the splintered likeness of a person. I step 
past, into the darkness. The smell is overpowering; I put my 
hand over my mouth and nose but it sears inside, threatening 
to drag out the contents of my stomach.</p>

<p id="p500">I feel the echo ache of my severed cord, the silent scream 
of my cortex. I'm forced to work quick. I find a place, a cellar 
of sorts. Rats glare as I scrape a patch of dirt with my heel. 
The ground's soft, more mud than earth. I dig down, create a 
hole, deep enough. I place the device inside, cover it with the 
clogging clay then press down with my feet, trampling straw 
into the surface. Concealed.</p>

<p id="p501">The air outside brings little relief. The sky is a glower. 
Exploratory drops of rain parachute down, spotting the street. 
I walk back to the cathedral. Its bells are ringing, calling the 
faithful.</p>

<p id="p502">I close my eyes. Vision my way back. I rise, floating 
above the city. Its lines blur, ghosting back through time. I'm 
bird-high above it now. Lines crumble, fall. Fade back into</p>

'Just as you asked.'</p>

<p id="p509">'Meaning?' I raise a smile. The insults bounce off me.
'Secretive. Like closed books.'
'Closed atlases, perhaps.'

We stroll through the pristine courtyard of the Uffizi, our 
shadows stretching out before us. The warmth of the sun does 
its best to lift my spirits. Merchants and bankers eye each other 
with secular mistrust, slaves to gods of gold and greed. Bells 
from nearby churches call the diminishing faithful to worship 
at another altar.</p>

<p id="p517">'You are sure?' My friend passes through a group of men 
arguing in allegro Florentine. 'It will be a one-way journey. No 
map to guide you back.'</p>

<p id="p518">I stare out towards the Arno, a thread of gold veined 
through the city's heart. 'It's the only way.'</p>

<p id="p519">'Why Edinburgh? Why not somewhere more dramatic? 
The Five Points of New York, or the revolutionary streets of 
Paris, perhaps.'</p>

<p id="p520">'It's personal.' I leave it at that.
'And you're sure four hundred years is long enough? For

fulfil its purpose.</p>

'No, my friend. I question your motives.'
A group of barefoot children scuttle past, laughing and 
shouting. 'Believe me, I have explored every other possibility.'</p>

'You will unravel a thread which cannot be repaired. The

<p id="p528">'We had no right to make them in the first place. We should 
have left the past alone.'</p>

<p id="p529">'Some good has come of it, surely?'
'It was never our right.'
The children are gone. The courtyard is empty. 'Then 
whose right was it? God's?'</p>

<p id="p531">'Why tell me?' he asks. 'Aren't you afraid I will try to stop 
you?'</p>

<p id="p532">'I tell you so you have a chance to be as far from the Atlas

We rise, unfolding ourselves from the map. The streets of 
Florence become sketches once more, inked on centuries-old 
parchment.</p>

towards me through the mistplane. 'I have made up my mind.'</p>

I wish him farewell, but we're already out.</p>

it was, forty-eight years ago. Less cluttered, enough room to</p>

<p id="p537">breathe. A city with a dream of its future.</p>

<p id="p538">I calibrate my cortex like a compass.
The lines rise. The ordered grid of the New Town, a refined 
matrix shimmering above my desk. The spinal column of the 
Royal Mile, its closes thin arteries threading down on either 
side. The crown of St Giles, rising above it all.</p>

<p id="p539">I'm in.
The smells are familiar, though the air tastes cleaner. The 
High Street is busy; the Festival is in full swing. Crowds jostle 
outside the cathedral, craning necks for the best view of a thin 
man in a dinner jacket performing magic tricks.</p>

<p id="p540">I look up. Twin contrails crisscross the blue sky, creating a 
saltire. Tourists point up with boxy cameras. I take solace from 
it: a portent, a sign of forthcoming victory.</p>

<p id="p541">I cross the street, the cobbles worn beneath my shoes. The 
house has trebled in height since I was last here. It stands 
squeezed between its siblings, its ground floor given over to a 
shop which claims to sell only the finest Scottish goods.</p>

<p id="p542">I wonder, looking up at the sightless sockets of its windows, 
if the building remembers. If it has an awareness of its past, of 
its youth, when it slouched here with surly teenage confidence. 
I wonder if it had a premonition of what it would become, what 
its place on the map would be.</p> 

<p id="p543">A cold wind. I feel them. The others.
They're coming.
I imagine them, paging through their copies of the Atlas, 
trying to locate me. My friend had been right: they would 
be expecting somewhere more dramatic, somewhere more 
intricately mapped.</p>

<p id="p544">But they've still found me. The echo of my cortex, pulsing 
like a pinprick dot on a radar. And now they raise the lines 
from their own copies of the same map, zooming into these 
same streets.</p>

<p id="p545">I don't have much time.
I enter the shop. Slip behind the counter, through the</p>

heady and thick.</p>

<p id="p547">A cellar door, metal. Locked. I close my eyes, sketch out a 
map of the room. The lines blue, like an architect's drawing. I 
alter them.</p>

<p id="p548">The hole gapes in the floor. Darkness.
I don't need light. I can sense the device, its energy. Still 
here, where I buried it yesterday, four hundred years ago. 
Where it has lain, charging. And now primed, ready.</p>

<p id="p549">Ready for the final map to be drawn.
I hear them. In the shop, above me. Their footsteps, hurried. 
Desperate.</p>

<p id="p550">I crouch down. The cellar floor is packed earth. I detect the 
device. Uncover it.</p>

<p id="p551">It pulses in my hands. The lines on the globe inside it glow. 
Another world.</p>

<p id="p552">A better world.
I open the device, separate the hemispheres of the globe 
with a seismic twist of my wrist. The core inside is a brilliant 
star, warm to the touch.</p>

<p id="p553">Voices above me. The lines of the cellar shift. I close my 
fingers around the shining heart of the world.</p>

<p id="p554">It was a good choice. Edinburgh. Here, now, in nineteen 
sixty-seven.</p>

<p id="p555">It was here, in this city. Where I met her. A long time ago.

We'll never meet. She'll never be. Not as she was.

Bedlam Theatre.
Christine De Luca.</p>

<p id="p631">The good doctor fretted over Fergusson, determined
none should suffer in a Poor House or a Mad House.
A good diet would build them up: porridge, broth 
and mutton meals; and plenty exercise of course.
It took 40 years to assuage that poet's death, to found 
the hospital for those whose mental health was fragile; 
and 30 more before those Bedlam doors were closed.
Just as inmates left for Morningside, a striking kirk 
ship-shaped that Bristo corner, too late to be of help.
No psalm will greet you now, no elder shake your hand 
at the red door; a fellow student may welcome you, ask
your mission, whether acting, lighting, sound. Step inside! 
Learn the ropes here, join the illustrious band of Bedlamites. 
Lose and find yourself; work a different kind of healing.</p>

<p id="p636">Candlemaker Row.
Greyfriars.
Jane Alexander.</p>

<p id="p637">The streets are just as they should be; which surprises me every 
time. I'm at the Haymarket junction, the train station in front of 
me, the Hearts memorial clock at my back, and to my right the 
main road running out of city. With a southwest wind, here's 
where you'd catch it: that sweet spot equidistant from the North 
British Distillery and the Caledonian Brewery. But we have no 
wind, of course, not yet – though the skin team are working 
on it, because how can we call it Edinburgh without a brisk 
southwesterly?</p> 

<p id="p638">With no carrying breeze, I turn my head, tilt it; feeling for 
the right angle. I take a couple of cautious steps, trusting Marek 
to steer me away from obstacles. It ought to be easier than this. 
'Still elusive,' I say. My voice sounds blunt and distant.</p> 

<p id="p639">There. I catch it: hold the angle, inhaling carefully. 'Much 
better, now,' I say. 'But … still too thin. Too flat.' It has to be alive, 
this smell. Yeasty and bubbling. I wrinkle my nose. 'Top note 
of dust. Stale white bread.' I'm trying to taste what's missing. 
Something rich, and tangy. 'Marek … you know the frequency 
we're using for the Nor' Loch? Can you adjust the signals in that 
direction – just a tiny, tiny bit?'</p> 

<p id="p640">The tweaks will take him a couple of minutes. I could do it 
quicker, but first I'd have to shed all the gear – the headset, the 
gloves, the mouthpiece – and that would take longer in the end. 
So I wait, instead, at the junction which is just as it should be – 
and yet, not quite. This was a transport interchange, constant 
with buses and trams, with trains and taxis and cars; above 
all, with people. And there will be people after we launch – all 
our users, interacting. Right now, though, the streets are static, 
silent. It could be crack of dawn on a Sunday morning, if the sun</p>

<page number="165" proc="no">

<heading>149</heading>

<p id="p641">wasn't centred above me.</p>   

<p id="p642">'Ah, Jesus!' A sudden nauseous stink overwhelms me. I cough 
and retch as I swipe for the touchpad, my gloved hands clumsy. 
The headset gets caught in my hair as Marek manoeuvres it off 
– and I'm blinking, back in the strip-lit lab. I use my tongue to 
pop the mouthpiece free, and spit it out onto my lap. 'Water!' I 
say, holding up my robot mitts. Marek eases the gloves off, lays 
them neatly on the trolley before handing me a bottle. I gulp, 
swooshing away the lingering, rancid smell.</p> 

<p id="p643">'Too much?' says Marek.
'Just a bit.' I shake my head as he starts to apologise. 'Don't 
worry. Trial and error.'</p>

<p id="p644">'Do you want to tweak it? Try again?'
A flatness in his voice makes me glance up, check the time. 
It's late – after seven. I know Marek has a new baby daughter at 
home, a girlfriend counting the minutes. I also know he'll stay 
on, if I ask him to. I hesitate. Just one more try wouldn't take us 
long, and we're so nearly there. But then I think of Candlemaker 
Row. How close it is.</p> 

<p id="p645">'Let's leave it,' I say, casually. 'Come fresh to it tomorrow.' 
When Marek is gone, I rinse the mouthpiece, lay it aside for 
sterilisation. I should eat something, but that appalling smell has 
stolen my appetite. I'll never be hungry again. I glance at the 
frequencies he used, note down some adjustments to try later 
on. I could get away with what we've got, I'm sure – but it has 
to be right. Of all the olfactory details, this is the one we'll be 
judged on. This is the one that says Edinburgh. Remember, the 
first time we smelled it? Late September: the coach nosing its 
way towards the city centre, and the smell so warm, so thick I 
could practically chew it. Remember, I pulled a face, and buried 
my nose in your shoulder; it didn't yet mean home.</p> 

<p id="p646">I run my gaze down the Gantt chart, admiring the ticks that 
show how many smells we've recreated. Roasting coffee from</p> 


</page>
<page number="166" proc="no">

<heading>150</heading>

<p id="p647">the police-box kiosks; fresh cut grass for the Meadows; the 
damp, closed smell of underground Edinburgh, its vaults and 
buried streets. My ghost smells are coming along, too: cocoa 
and rubber from the Fountainbridge factories; and for Princes 
Street Gardens, a faint reminder of the Nor' Loch, its previous 
life as the city's cesspit.</p> 

<p id="p648">One day we'll have ghost people alongside my ghost smells. 
The technology isn't there yet – but when it is, we'll start with 
the old favourites: Mary Queen of Scots, Deacon Brodie, Robert 
Louis Stevenson. You'd roll your eyes at that: history for tourists. 
But how perfect to bring them back, the lives that were layered 
into this city. And we have to start somewhere.</p>

<p id="p649">Half past seven. If I time it right, I'll catch Rob on his own 
for a progress update. I loop my pass around my neck, and leave 
my basement lair. 
The ground floor is deserted, silent but for the hum of the 
vending machine. Its lighted window draws me in; I decide 
I'm hungry after all. The machine offers me its last remaining 
sandwich, pushes it forward, lets it drop. Egg mayonnaise. I take 
it, and carry on upstairs.</p> 

<p id="p650">In the first floor studio, glowing screens show where a 
handful of people are working late. There are more of us, usually. 
Those for whom it's a labour of love. Who lost the lot, when it 
happened; lost more than a home. More than a repository of 
memories. I wander from section to empty section – and then 
I realise. It's Friday night. Everyone else is tucked up with their 
families, or out on the town with friends.</p> 

<p id="p651">Instead of turning back on myself, I press deeper into the 
studio. I didn't mean to grow attached to this workspace that's 
half science lab, half art school, but I find a sense of purpose 
here that's absent from anywhere else. A sense of necessary, 
urgent invention.
Perhaps some of the urgency comes from the pictures. In my</p>

<p id="p652">little lab, there's nothing to see. Grey benches, metal shelving, 
all my bits and bobs stored neatly in plastic tubs. What we're 
creating, Marek and I, it has no external reference, no source 
material. But here… Sometimes it feels like walking through a 
brighter version of my own head. Sometimes, it's like walking 
through wreckage.</p> 

<p id="p653">In the aftermath, the internet buckled under the weight of 
memories. It was a tidal wave, millions of people all desperately 
remembering. Sharing whatever they had, in the hope that 
sharing would keep it alive. A lot of it was holiday snaps: the 
predictable route from castle to palace; the classic glimpse of 
New Town elegance through the dark of an Old Town close. Or 
cameraphone footage: from Calton Hill, the shaky 360 degrees 
of city… hills… sea… Visitors' Edinburgh, a tourist fantasy. 
That's what you used to say. You dismissed it, said it wasn't real. 
You were right, in a way: it was just too beautiful, too heart-
stoppingly beautiful, to exist. Perhaps it never did: perhaps we 
dreamed it. A thousand-year consensual hallucination.</p> 

<p id="p654">And now here we are – programmers and designers, 
scientists and sound artists, engineers and animators – all trying 
our hardest to dream it back.</p>

<p id="p655">There was other stuff too, in the tide of images. Architects' 
drawings. City masterplans. Slowly, people began to piece it 
all together: interactive maps, 3D simulations. Google Earth 
filled a lot of gaps. A call went out for the overlooked spaces. 
Thornybauk. Chuckie Pend. And when our project was set up – 
the Edinburgh Reboot – we gathered it all in.</p>   

<p id="p656">Each team works on a different section, so as I wander 
the studio I'm walking through a mad jigsaw: the Canongate 
bumped up against the Meadows, the Cowgate leading to 
Moray Crescent. And in some of the photos are people. People 
like you, mostly. Dead people. I look back in time at a disaster 
that's yet to happen; the way the road speeds towards you and  / 
vanishes at the same time in the rearview mirror.</p>

<p id="p657">At first I think Rob's gone home for the weekend. His section is 
dark, lights and screens powered down. It's the smell that alerts 
me: malted barley, faint cousin of the aroma I've been struggling 
with. Then I see him, slumped at his desk, hand wrapped round 
an open beer.</p>

<p id="p658">'Alright?' he says, tipping the bottle towards me. 'Want one?'
'Yeah, sure.' I perch on the desk opposite his, click the 
Anglepoise on, and rip open my sandwich. 'D'you mind if I 
eat this? Can't downstairs; it's too eggy.' It's true: even a packet 
of crisps, an instant coffee, could taint the air for hours. When 
Marek first started working with me, I gave him a present of 
fragrance-free deodorant and unscented washing powder.</p> 

<p id="p659">I lift my bottle: 'Cheers.' In the sharply-angled light, Rob 
looks knackered, his face criss-crossed with deep dark lines. 
'What are we celebrating?' I say. 'Just, Friday night?'</p>

<p id="p660">He smiles. Shakes his head. 'It's finished,' he says.
I swallow. Put down my sandwich. 'Seriously?'
'I mean, there'll be snagging, obviously, but…' He raises his 
fist, like he'd be punching the air if only he had the energy.</p>  

<p id="p661">'Wow. Well done, you must be… this should be champagne!'
'Yeah well, hopefully it'll get Kate off my back for a bit.' 
 I nod. His team have been running behind schedule, and 
everyone says it's not his fault. It's a difficult section of the city 
– small, but difficult. Different levels, sharp angles. The way it 
all fits together. 'She seen it yet?' I say, and he shakes his head.</p> 

<p id="p662">'Monday.'
My mouth is dry; I take a swig of beer. Hear myself asking: 
'Need a walk-through first?'</p>

<p id="p663">Rob straightens up in his chair, looks around at the empty 
office. 'Ah, no I couldn't ask you to. What time is it, past eight? 
You'll be wanting to get home.'</p> 

<p id="p664">I set the bottle down. The glass clinking on the desk makes 
a definite sound. I know how much he needs this. A lot of the 
staff were never in Edinburgh; some visited once, for a week 
in August. So people like me, whose lives were there, we're in</p> 


</page>
<page number="169" proc="no">

<heading>153</heading>

<p id="p665">demand for walk-throughs. Team leaders tend to approach 
me cautiously – but I've always said yes, and I've always 
been professional. If I've ever needed to cry – if, for instance, 
they've asked me to test the Water of Leith from Stockbridge 
to Roseburn, and I've walked in the vanished footsteps of our 
Sunday strolls, walked all the way along with my hand closed 
round the absence of yours – then I've swallowed my loss; made 
my report on the authenticity of the terrain; locked myself in the 
disabled toilet before I fall apart.</p>

<p id="p666">'Honestly,' I say. 'I'm dying to see it.'
The testing room is blindingly bright after the dark of the studio. 
I've swapped my trainers for stability shoes, laced them up tight; 
on the platform, I slot my feet into place. I strap on the support 
belt and attach it to the safety ring, then Rob helps me on with 
the rest of the kit: the gloves, the headset. When he settles the 
headphones over my ears, I can hear my blood thumping.</p> 

<p id="p667">'I'm actually kind of nervous,' he says.
'Me too.' But I say it softly, and I'm not sure whether he 
hears. 
The first thing is, the light is wrong. Twilight setting: no good 
for a walk-through. I should swipe out, ask Rob to change it. 
But then my eyes adjust and I see that it's been raining; and 
I think how long it's been waiting for me, this place. Over my 
shoulder squats Castle Rock, built from code and light, pinning 
the Grassmarket by the tail under its great rugged weight.</p>  

<p id="p668">I tilt my head back to see what they've done with the sky. 
Dull, pinkish clouds are tugging across the darkening blue, 
blown by a wind that doesn't touch me. As I watch, the clouds 
pull apart to reveal a two-thirds moon. How long would I have 
to crane upwards to notice the repeat – the exact same moment 
looped round again? But they've done a good job; I haven't seen</p> 


</page>
<page number="170" proc="no">

<heading>154</heading>

<p id="p669">a sky like this before. No wonder it's taken so long.</p> 

<p id="p670">I start to walk. Streetlights spill across the wet stone flags, 
which change to setts under my feet, and back to roughened 
flagstones. The familiar pubs line the north side of the square, 
their faces just right – and I'm caught in a sudden wash of music, 
of voices and laughter, as though a door has opened briefly, as 
though there are lives inside. The Black Bull. The White Hart. 
The Last Drop. My chest feels tight. I walk on, past the gallows 
memorial. Here, by the chip shop, is where I'll place the stale 
fat and vinegar tang. Here, by the dark arched mouth of the 
Cowgate, is where I'll streak the air with a trace of urine, that 
faint Friday-night sweetness.</p> 

<p id="p671">I'm climbing now, up Candlemaker Row. Past the high walls 
of the kirkyard, the odd assortment of shops, past Deadhead 
and Transreal and the tattoo parlour. My breath coming faster, 
legs working harder, as if I really am walking uphill. And when I 
reach the top of the street, I stop.</p> 

<p id="p672">Four floors up: that's us. They've made the tenements too 
tall, the roofs blurring into the stone-coloured sky, so our flat's 
too distant from me. But it's the only one with a light on. A 
coincidence, a random choice by Rob or one of his team. I find 
myself thinking it's lucky we stayed central, weren't lured to 
suburbs that will never be rebooted, that we stayed tucked up in 
our crows-nest flat. Except of course if we had moved out, gone 
far enough from the centre, you and I would be there still. A 
twisted kind of luck, then. The same luck that meant I was away 
when it happened: travelling home on a train that shuddered to 
a halt somewhere outside Berwick, sat stranded while the news 
blazed through the carriages: impossible, incomprehensible.</p>

<p id="p673">Our window glows. Inside, in the kitchen, you'd be cooking, 
keeping an eye on the time: my train would be getting in soon, 
and it's a ten minute walk from Waverley, and you'd want to 
have dinner ready. You want to welcome me back.</p> 

<p id="p674">I cross the road.
The familiar black of our front door. The cold stone lintel.</p> 


</page>
<page number="171" proc="no">

<heading>155</heading>

<p id="p675">The handle, smooth against my palm. I grasp it. Turn it. Press 
my weight against the door, and push.</p>

<p id="p676">Nothing happens. Of course. Nothing can happen. There is 
no inside. If the door could move, it would only swing open to 
absence.</p>

<p id="p677">I hear my name – and just for a moment, I let myself believe. 
You're calling me. You have the sash drawn up, and you're leaning 
out, looking down at me. You think I must have forgotten my 
keys, and that's why I'm waiting. That's why I'm stuck outside.</p> 

<p id="p678">Rob calls again. He wants to know, is something wrong? Has 
it frozen? Do I need a restart? Everything's fine, I tell him. Turn 
around, and cross the street once more.</p> 

<p id="p679">I start to think of what's missing, what's not quite right; 
turning in a slow circle, trying to do my job. I let my gaze 
sweep loosely over spires and blocks and towers – and there's 
something wrong about the angles, or I think so at first – but 
then, how could I remember? How could I be expected to 
remember? Chances are he's got it right – Rob, who never lived 
here, who didn't know these walls, these stones, this sky. With all 
his source material, chances are his version is truer than mine. I 
can't keep it all inside. Not forever.</p> 

<p id="p680">I carry on turning. The small silhouette of Greyfriars Bobby, 
endlessly waiting on his plinth, too daft to understand the 
finality of death. I walk around to the front of the statue to check 
his nose. I can't fault it: shiny, brassy as if from all the hands that 
have rubbed it for luck.</p>

<p id="p681">I rest the tips of my fingers against the worn bronze.
'Stupid animal,' I say.
I raise my hand towards the touch panel, ready to come out. 
That's when I see it. A flicker, up at the kitchen window: like 
someone moving behind the glass, crossing the room.</p> 

<p id="p682">'Rob—' I say, and my voice sounds panicked and then I 
press my lips shut. In the time it takes to refocus, the movement 
has gone. All that's shifted is the air. In the back of my throat I 
taste it, something hollow and deep. A gaping smell of damp</p> 


</page>
<page number="172" proc="no">

<heading>156</heading>

<p id="p683">and dust.</p>

<p id="p684">I can hear Rob in the other world asking what's the matter, 
but I tune him out. I call your name instead: in silence, inside 
me. I call you like a summons.</p>

<p id="p685">If I wait long enough, I'll see the repeat, the exact same glitch 
come round again. Or I'll see you cross the room, come to the 
glass and look in my direction.</p> 

<p id="p686">You have to start somewhere; that's why we're rebuilding – 
but it's not the smell of the brewery that means home. It's not 
this dreamed, split-level city. It's not the glowing window in the 
gathering dark. All of this was only ever a frame. 
I stare, trying not to blink. Breathe cold earth and stone.  /

Grange Cemetery.
Viccy Adams.</p>

<p id="p775">The low wall in the back section of the Grange Cemetery was 
where she and James used to sit and wait for their parents to 
catch them up. Janet holds her gloves palm-down over the 
scabs where the council has picked the stone clean of moss, 
then smells them. Standing straight, she can see the spire of the 
church across the road from what used to be her grandparents' 
flat.</p>

<p id="p776">Ham on white, no tomato. Bums protected from the wet by 
plastic bags, slipping and rustling. Complaining that there were 
no crisps. Laughing at James as he tried to sound out the names 
on the Egyptian-style gravestones. Running so fast they never 
fell but they flew round fallen granite and over patchy mud. 
Unexpected bruises surfacing in the bath days later from the 
half-games of pushing and balancing along tomb boundaries.</p>

<p id="p777">One time, the time she remembers most, the bent-over man 
with a stick and tears in his eyes shaking and trembling as he 
hissed at them, 'There are people's people buried here, you 
know.'</p>

<p id="p778">Running away and neither of them mentioning it to Mam 
and Dad. Still, the rest of the summer holidays Janet had heard 
it in the wind through the pine trees and the repetition of the 
car tyres on the tarmac as they toured. There are peoples' people 
buried here you know.</p> 

<p id="p779">She turns her back and closes her eyes to let the birdsong 
and muted traffic seep in. The morning-cereal crunch of slow 
footsteps on gravel is followed by the fumble of a large gloved 
hand gripping hers. Janet knows that if she opens her eyes then 
she will see it again, that slick and clean headstone so shockingly 
pink. Far pinker than the granite had looked in the catalogue.</p>

Adam
Adam's hands are pushing deep into his pockets and he's 
turning his face out of the wind, away from her. He's telling her 
he doesn't see the point in them staying a second night at her 
parents' house; he has an essay to write he'd forgotten about, 
his books are back in Leeds.</p>

<p id="p782">Janet takes him off the path and onto the wet grass, slipping 
round the solid gold of crocuses and into one of the wide divots 
of the Bruntsfield Links.</p>

<p id="p783">She turns him sideways in the wind until there are tears in 
his eyes and he is facing the backside of the city.</p>

<p id="p784">He cannot see the old walls from here, but he can take in the 
wideness of the Meadows and agree to the existence of ancient 
boundaries.</p>

<p id="p785">She tells him they are off limits, beyond the outskirts. The 
green heaves under their feet were formed by the decaying 
bodies of the dead in the limed mass graves hastily excavated 
and then rammed with cart-driven corpses from the plague-
decimated closes off the Mile. 'And now it's a public golf course,' 
she finishes.</p>

<p id="p786">He blinks through the eye-filling wind, says he doesn't see 
anyone playing golf. Janet looks down to hide her face and she 
sees the stains tidal on his suede shoes from the wet grass she 
has brought him onto.</p>

Michael
He really, really wants her to tell him what she thinks it must 
be like to be an extinct volcano. Janet's running out of ways</p> 


</page>
<page number="200" proc="no">

<heading>184</heading>

<p id="p788">of saying that she doesn't know without him noticing that she 
doesn't care. A mid-afternoon stag party passes the plate glass 
window on their way to the next-door strip bar and one of 
them sticks his head in the half open door and winks at her.</p>

<p id="p789">She's toying with the gold-rimmed vintage saucer of 
beetroot and chipotle cake that she wishes she hadn't ordered. 
Half an eye is on on that group in the corner crowded round 
the closed lid of a piano, because if they do leave – which they 
might have done ages ago, had they any consideration for 
customers with full cups and plates – then she wouldn't have 
to balance like this by the till. In the meantime she pretends she 
is enjoying drinking the artisanal flat white while standing up 
and being jostled by the queue.</p>

<p id="p790">He offers again to hold her coat – which is quite sweet 
really, when she thinks about it – and asks what time dinner is 
booked for.</p>

<p id="p791">'Seven. We're meeting at half six though. Dad has – well, 
you'll see. He has this thing about punctuality.'</p>

<p id="p792">'I'm really, really looking forward to meeting them,' Michael 
says. Janet sees the honesty shining out of his face and feels 
nothing but exhaustion.</p>

<p id="p793">*
April
'You could come on your own, sweetheart.' Her mother pauses 
opposite the city library to look over and down. Up ahead April 
is surrounded by a passing language school group admiring 
the full Escher's steps experience. 'James drops by all the time.'</p>

<p id="p794">Janet asks her mother to keep her voice down and links arms, 
pulls her closer, as if her body could block the words better 
than the blaring piper on the corner. 'He lives in Glasgow. It's 
hardly the same.'</p>

<p id="p795">'The spare room fits one just as well as two.'
They have already paced the tartan gauntlet of shops on the</p> 


</page>
<page number="201" proc="no">

<heading>185</heading>

<p id="p796">Royal Mile and now they are to be paraded round Greyfriars 
Bobby.</p>

<p id="p797">Over breakfast that morning, April trying to be polite. 
There's no need to treat me like a tourist. Her father, unsmiling, 
scraping marmalade on his toast. You never know when you'll be 
back in Auld Reekie. So here they are, being passive-aggressively 
chaperoned.</p> 

<p id="p798">An earshot in front, her father is walking stiff-legged next 
to April and lecturing her about how the statue of the wee dug 
should be facing the other way, towards the graveyard and 
his master's final resting place. His conspiracy theory about 
brown-envelope payments from the pub to have it turned 
around so the pub sign headlines tourist snaps.</p>

<p id="p799">April is promising not to take a photo, in mute protest. 
Then the world is drowned by the horn of a taxi as Janet 
steps out in front of of a loading bus. Her eyes lock into the 
sudden stop of the taxi's windshield and the angry white of the 
driver's knuckles on the steering wheel, peeking over his high 
dashboard.</p>

<p id="p800">Then she is on the other side, stomach growling at the 
smell of Italian cuisine from the vents in the sandstone wall 
that April is pushing her into. All three of their voices – April, 
her mother, her father – unified in scolding: are you trying to 
give me a heart-attack? Why do you never look where you're going? 
What were you thinking? And the odd, warm pleasure of being 
their common concern, their common complaint.</p>

<p id="p801">*
Now her other hand is being gripped too, gloves twined by 
those long, slender fingers. Red with the cold, she knows from 
experience. She pulls their combined fist into her coat pocket, 
awkwardly, while her brother coughs and hems and eventually 
lets go of her other hand to blow his nose.
April is the first one to speak. 'Do you remember them</p>

<p id="p802">bringing me here, for the Sunday walk, that first time I was 
invited to join in?'</p> 

<p id="p803">But the thing is, Janet doesn't. All those layers of memories, 
of people. Even as April goes on to talk about the sunshine 
and the warmth and the jokes, Janet is sifting her brain without 
success.</p>

<p id="p804">'We had a flask of tea, still too hot to drink when we stopped 
for lunch.' James is joining in and still nothing surfaces.</p> 

<p id="p805">She opens her eyes and the two of them are looking at 
each other, smiling. Then she realises – she hadn't been there. 
The first time April was alone with her family, without her 
padding out the conversation and protecting them both from 
embarrassment. Janet stuck in the spare room with a bucket by 
the bed and a plate of water biscuits.</p> 

<p id="p806">But April had gone out. The memory is thickening now, 
wiping over the cemetery like butter. Had come back rosy 
cheeked. I think they like me. It was okay, really it was. And it 
had been.</p> 

<p id="p807">The sun goes behind the weather and the colour of the 
stone darkens, becomes less lurid. James and April start to walk 
round to the entrance, muttering about rain. Janet tells them 
she'll catch them up. Reaches out to wipe the top of the granite 
with her glove, brushing her parent's deep-cut names with her  / 
thumb. There are peoples' people buried here you know.</p>

Bodies burned above the fagots, then buried 
beneath the gibbet, holding out its proud arm
in salute: Leith Walk is breathtaking

A young buck of twenty, hung for blasphemy. 
Matriculated, fresh arsed out of Uni; doubted God,
why not? doubted fiercely and learnt it, dead. 
Thomas Aikenhead, hung in silence - claimed his end.   
Here after, it's the longest stretch down to the port, 
out of this world. Street lined with many a staggerer,
slugged by some cursed sniper. Mumbling through 
the last of their blood as they totter, hugging grim walls.</p>
